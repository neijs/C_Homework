There is a hole at the bottom of math
00:04
a hole that  means we will never know everything with certainty
00:09
There will always be true statements that  cannot be proven.
00:14
Now no one knows what those statements are exactly
00:17
but they could be something like the Twin Prime Conjecture.
00:20
Twin primes are prime numbers that are separated  by just one number like 11 and 13, or 17 and 19.
00:27
And as you go up the number line primes occur less  frequently and twin primes are rarer still.
00:34
But the Twin Prime Conjecture is that there are infinitely  many twin primes.
00:38
You never run out them.
00:41
As of right now no one has proven this conjecture true or false.
00:46
But the crazy thing is this: we may never know
00:51
because what has been proven is that in any system  of mathematics where you can do basic arithmetic
00:57
there will always be true statements  that are impossible to prove.
01:03
That is life.
01:07
Specifically this is the Game of Life,  created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway
01:13
Sadly he passed away in 2020 from covet  19. Conway's game of life is played on an
01:20
infinite grid of square cells each of which is  either live or dead and there are only two rules
01:28
one any dead cell with exactly three neighbors  comes to life and two any living cell with less
01:35
than two or more than three neighbors dies once  you've set up the initial arrangement of cells
01:42
the two rules are applied to create the  next generation and then the one after that
01:46
and the one after that and so on it's totally  automatic Conway called it a zero player game
01:53
but even though the rules are simple the game  itself can generate a wide variety of behavior
01:59
some patterns are stable once they arise they  never change others oscillate back and forth in a
02:05
loop a few can travel across the grid forever like  this glider here many patterns just fizzle out
02:18
but a few keep growing forever  they keep generating new cells
02:25
now you would think that given the  simple rules of the game you could just
02:28
look at any pattern and determine what will happen  to it will it eventually reach a steady state
02:34
or will it keep growing without limit but it  turns out this question is impossible to answer
02:42
the ultimate fate of a pattern in Conway's  game of life is undecidable meaning there
02:48
is no possible algorithm that is guaranteed to  answer the question in a finite amount of time
02:54
you could always just try running the pattern and  see what happens i mean the rules of the game are
02:58
a kind of algorithm after all but that's not  guaranteed to give you an answer either because
03:04
even if you run it for a million generations  you won't be able to say whether it'll last
03:08
forever or just 2 million generations  or a billion or a googleplex
03:14
is there something special about the game of life  that makes it undecidable nope there are actually
03:21
a huge number of systems that are undecidable  like Wang tiles quantum physics airline ticketing
03:28
systems and even magic the gathering to understand  how undecidability shows up in all of these places
03:36
we have to go back 150 years to a  full-blown revolt in mathematics
03:45
in 1874 Georg Cantor a german mathematician  published a paper that launched a new branch
03:51
of mathematics called set theory a set is  just a well-defined collection of things
03:57
so the two shoes on your feet are a set as are  all the planetariums in the world there's a set
04:03
with nothing in it the empty set and a set with  everything in it now Cantor was thinking about
04:09
sets of numbers like natural numbers positive  integers like 1 2 3 4 and so on and real numbers
04:17
which include fractions like a third five  halves and also irrational numbers like pi e
04:23
and the square root of two basically any number  that can be represented as an infinite decimal
04:30
he wondered are there more natural numbers  or more real numbers between zero and one
04:38
the answer might seem obvious there are  an infinite number of each so both sets
04:43
should be the same size but to check this logic  canter imagined writing down an infinite list
04:49
matching up each natural number on one side with  a real number between zero and one on the other
04:54
now since each real number is an infinite decimal  there is no first one so we can just write them
05:00
down in any random order the key is to make sure  we get them all with no duplicates and line them
05:06
up one to one with an integer if we can do that  with none left over well then we know that the
05:13
set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers  between 0 and 1 are the same size so assume we've
05:20
done that we have a complete infinite list with  each integer acting like an index number a unique
05:26
identifier for each real number on the list now  Cantor says start writing down a new real number
05:34
and the way we're going to do it is by taking the  first digit of the first number and adding one
05:40
then take the second digit of the second number  and again add one take the third digit of the
05:45
third number add one and keep doing this all the  way down the list if the digit is a nine just roll
05:51
it back to an eight and by the end of this process  you'll have a real number between zero and one but
05:58
here's the thing this number won't appear anywhere  on our list it's different from the first number
06:05
in the first decimal place different from the  second number in the second decimal place and
06:09
so on down the line it has to be different from  every number on the list by at least one digit
06:15
the number on the diagonal that's why this  is called Cantor's diagonalization proof
06:22
it shows there must be more real numbers between  0 and 1 then there are natural numbers extending
06:29
out to infinity so not all infinities are the same  size Cantor call these countable and uncountable
06:38
infinities respectively and in fact there are many  more uncountable infinities which are even larger
06:44
now Cantor's work was just the latest blow to  mathematics for 2000 years Euclid's elements
06:49
were considered the bedrock of the discipline but  at the turn of the 19th century Lobashevsky and
06:55
gauss discovered non-Euclidean geometries and  this prompted mathematicians to examine more
07:00
closely the foundations of their field and they  did not like what they saw the idea of a limit
07:07
at the heart of calculus turned out to be poorly  defined and now Cantor was showing that infinity
07:13
itself was much more complex than anyone had  imagined in all this upheaval mathematics
07:19
fractured and a huge debate broke out among  mathematicians at the end of the 1800s on the
07:24
one side were the intuitionists who thought that  Cantor's work was nonsense they were convinced
07:30
that math was a pure creation of the human mind  and that infinities like Cantors weren't real
07:37
Henri Poincaré said that later generations will  regard set theory as a disease from which one
07:42
has recovered Leopold Kronecker called Cantor a  scientific charlatan and a corrupter of the youth
07:49
and he worked to keep Cantor from getting a job  he wanted on the other side were the formalists
07:55
they thought that math could be put on absolutely  secure logical foundations through Cantor's set
08:00
theory the informal leader of the formalists  was the german mathematician David Hilbert
08:06
Hilbert was a living legend a hugely influential  mathematician who had worked in nearly every area
08:12
of mathematics he almost beat Einstein to the  punch on general relativity he developed entirely
08:17
new mathematical concepts that were crucial for  quantum mechanics and he knew that Cantor's work
08:22
was brilliant Hilbert was convinced that a more  formal and rigorous system of mathematical proof
08:28
based on set theory could solve all the issues  that had cropped up in math over the last century
08:34
and most other mathematicians agreed with him no  one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor
08:39
has created Hilbert declared but in 1901 Bertrand  Russell pointed out a serious problem in Cantor's
08:46
set theory Russell knew that if sets can contain  anything they can contain other sets or even
08:52
themselves for example the set of all sets must  contain itself as does the set of sets with more
08:59
than five elements in them you could even talk  about the set of all sets that contain themselves
09:04
but this leads straight to a problem what about r  the set of all sets that don't contain themselves
09:12
if r doesn't contain itself well then it must  contain itself but if r does contain itself
09:18
then by definition it must not contain itself so r  contains itself if and only if it doesn't Russell
09:27
had found another paradox of self-reference and  he later explained his paradox using a hairy
09:33
analogy let's say there's a village populated  entirely by grown men with a strange law against
09:39
beards specifically the law states that the  village barber must shave all and only those men
09:44
of the village who do not shave themselves but the  barber himself lives in the village too of course
09:51
and he's a man so who shaves him if he doesn't  shave himself then the barber has to shave him
09:58
but the barber can't shave himself because the  barber doesn't shave anyone who shaves themselves
10:03
so the barber must shave himself if and only if  he doesn't shave himself it's a contradiction
10:11
the intuitionists rejoiced at Russell's  paradox thinking it had proven set theory
10:15
hopelessly flawed but zermelo and other  mathematicians from Hilbert school
10:20
solved the problem by restricting the concept of  a set so the collection of all sets for example is
10:26
not a set anymore and neither is the collection  of all sets which don't contain themselves
10:31
this eliminated the paradoxes that  come with self-reference Hilbert and
10:35
the formalists lived to fight another day but  self-reference refused to die quite that easily
10:43
fast forward to the 1960s and mathematician Hao  Wang was looking at square tiles with different
10:48
colors on each side like these the rules were  that touching edges must be the same color
10:54
and you can't rotate or reflect tiles only slide  them around the question was if you're given an
11:00
arbitrary set of these tiles can you tell if they  will tile the plane that is will they connect
11:06
up with no gaps all the way out to infinity it  turns out you can't tell for an arbitrary set of
11:13
tiles whether they will tile the plane or not  the problem is undecidable just like the fate
11:20
of a pattern in Conway's game of life in fact  it's exactly the same problem and that problem
11:26
ultimately comes from self-reference as Hilbert  and the formalists were about to discover
11:33
Hilbert wanted to secure the foundations of  mathematics by developing a new system for
11:38
mathematical proofs systems of proof were an old  idea going back to the ancient greeks a system of
11:44
proof starts with axioms basic statements that  are assumed to be true like a straight line can
11:49
be drawn between any two points proofs are then  constructed from those axioms using rules of
11:55
inference methods for using existing statements  to derive new statements and these are chosen to
12:00
preserve truth the existing statements are true  then so are the new ones Hilbert wanted a formal
12:07
system of proof a symbolic logical language with a  rigid set of manipulation rules for those symbols
12:13
logical and mathematical statements could then  be translated into this system if you drop a
12:18
book then it will fall would be a then b and no  human is immortal would be expressed like this
12:28
Hilbert and the formalists wanted to express  the axioms of mathematics as symbolic statements
12:32
in a formal system and set up the rules  of inference as the system's rules for
12:37
symbol manipulation so Russell  along with Alfred North Whitehead
12:42
developed a formal system like this in  their three-volume Principia Mathematica
12:46
published in 1913. Principia Mathematica is vast a  total of nearly 2 000 pages of dense mathematical
12:54
notation it takes 762 pages just to get to a  complete proof that one plus one equals two
13:03
at which point Russell and Whitehead dryly note  the above proposition is occasionally useful
13:09
the authors had originally planned  a fourth volume but unsurprisingly
13:13
they were too worn out to complete it so yes  the notation is dense and exhausting but it is
13:20
also exact unlike ordinary languages it leaves  no room for errors or fuzzy logic to creep in
13:28
and most importantly it allows you to prove  properties of the formal system itself
13:36
there were three big questions that  Hilbert wanted answered about mathematics
13:40
number one is math complete meaning is there a  way to prove every true statement does every true
13:48
statement have a proof number two is mathematics  consistent meaning is it free of contradictions
13:56
i mean if you can simultaneously prove a and not  a then that's a real problem because you can prove
14:03
anything at all and number three is math  decidable meaning is there an algorithm that
14:10
can always determine whether a statement follows  from the axioms now Hilbert was convinced that
14:17
the answers to all three of these questions was  yes at a major conference in 1930 Hilbert gave
14:25
a fiery speech about these questions he ended it  with a line that summed up his formalist dream in
14:31
opposition to the foolish ignorabimus which means we  will not know our slogan shall be we must know we
14:39
will know these words are literally on his grave  but by the time Hilbert gave this speech his dream
14:48
was already crumbling just the day before at a  small meeting at the same conference a 24 year old
14:54
logician named Kurt Gödel explained that he had  found the answer to the first of Hilbert's three
14:59
big questions about completeness and the answer  was no a complete formal system of mathematics
15:06
was impossible the only person who paid much  attention was John von Neumann one of Hilbert's
15:12
former students who pulled Gödel aside to ask a  few questions but the next year Gödel published
15:17
a proof of his incompleteness theorem and this  time everyone including Hilbert took notice
15:29
this is how Gödel's proof works Gödel  wanted to use logic and mathematics
15:35
to answer questions about the very system  of logic and mathematics and so he took
15:43
all these basic symbols of a mathematical  system and then he gave each one a number
15:51
this is known as the symbol's Gödel number  so the symbol for not gets the number one
15:58
or has the Gödel number two if then it's Gödel  number three now if you're expressing all of these
16:05
symbols with numbers then what do you do about  the numbers themselves well zero gets its own
16:11
Gödel number six and if you want to write a one  you just put this successor symbol next to it the
16:18
immediate successor of zero is 1. and if you  want to write 2 then you have to write ss0
16:26
and that represents 2 and so on so you could  represent any positive integer this way
16:31
granted it is cumbersome but it works  and that is the point of this system
16:36
so now that we have Gödel numbers for all of  the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might
16:42
want to use we can start to write equations  like we could write zero equals zero so these
16:50
symbols have the Gödel numbers six five six and  we can actually create a new card that represents
16:59
this equation zero equals zero and the way we  do it is we take the prime numbers starting at 2
17:07
and we raise each one to the power of the Gödel  number of the symbol in our equation so we have
17:14
2 to the power of 6 times 3 to the power of 5  times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million
17:21
so 243 million is the Gödel number  of the whole equation zero equals
17:29
zero we can write down Gödel numbers for  any set of symbols that you can imagine
17:36
so really this is an infinite deck of cards where  any set of symbols that you want to write down
17:42
in a sequence you can represent with a unique  Gödel number and the beauty of this Gödel
17:48
number is you can do a prime factorization of it  and you can work out exactly what symbols made up
17:55
this card so in this whole pack of cards  there are going to be true statements
18:01
and there are going to be false statements so how  do you prove that something is true well you need
18:07
to go to the axioms the axioms also have their own  Gödel numbers which are formed in the same way
18:15
so here's an axiom which says not the successor of  any number x equals zero which makes sense because
18:24
in this system there are no negative numbers and  so the successor of any number cannot be zero
18:30
so we can put down this axiom and then we can  substitute in zero for x saying that one does not
18:38
equal zero and we've created a proof this is the  simplest proof i can think of that shows that one
18:46
does not equal zero now this card for the proof of  one does not equal zero gets its own Gödel number
18:54
and the way we calculate this Gödel number  is just as before we take the prime numbers
18:59
and we raise 2 to the power of the axiom times  3 to the power of 1 does not equal 0 and we get
19:08
a tremendously large number it would have 73  million digits if you calculated it all out so
19:14
i've just left it here in exponential notation as  you can see these numbers get very large and so
19:22
you might want to start just calling them by  letters so we could say this one is Gödel
19:27
number a this is Gödel number b Gödel number  c and so on Gödel goes to all this trouble to find
19:36
this card which says there is no proof for the  statement with Gödel number g the trick is
19:46
that the Gödel number of this card is  g so what this statement is really saying
19:53
is this card is unprovable there is no proof  anywhere in our infinite deck for this card
20:01
now think about it if it's  false and there is a proof
20:05
then what you have just proven is there is  no proof so you're stuck with a contradiction
20:14
that would mean the mathematical system is  inconsistent the other alternative is that
20:20
this card is true there is no proof for the  statement with Gödel number g but that means
20:26
this mathematical system has true statements  in it that have no proof so your mathematical
20:33
system is incomplete and that is Gödel's  incompleteness theorem this is how he shows
20:40
that any basic mathematical system that can do  fundamental arithmetic will always have statements
20:47
within it which are true but which have no proof  there's a line in the tv show the office that
20:55
echoes the self-referential paradox of Gödel's  proof jim is my enemy but it turns out the jim
21:01
is also his own worst enemy and the enemy of my  enemy is my friend so jim is actually my friend
21:09
but because he is his own worst enemy the enemy
21:13
of my friend is my enemy so  actually jim is my enemy but
21:22
Gödel's incompleteness theorem means that  truth and provability are not at all the same
21:28
thing Hilbert was wrong there will always be true  statements about mathematics that just cannot
21:34
be proven now Hilbert could console himself with  the hope that at least we could still prove maths
21:39
consistent that is free of contradictions  but then Gödel published his second
21:44
incompleteness theorem in which he showed  that any consistent formal system of math
21:49
cannot prove its own consistency so taken together  Gödel's two incompleteness theorems say that the
21:56
best you can hope for is a consistent yet  incomplete system of math but a system like
22:03
that cannot prove its own consistency so some  contradiction could always crop up in the future
22:08
revealing that the system you'd been working with  had been inconsistent the whole time and that
22:13
leaves only the third and final big question from  Hilbert is mathematics decidable that is is there
22:19
an algorithm that can always determine whether  a statement follows from the axioms and in 1936
22:26
Alan Turing found a way to settle this question  but to do it he had to invent the modern computer
22:34
in his time computers weren't machines  they were people often women who carried
22:39
out long and tedious calculations Turing  imagined an entirely mechanical computer
22:45
he wanted it to be powerful enough to perform any  computation imaginable but simple enough that you
22:51
could reason through its operation so he came up  with a machine that takes as input an infinitely
22:57
long tape of square cells each containing a zero  or a one the machine has a read write head that
23:04
can read one digit at a time then it can perform  one of only a few tasks overwrite a new value
23:13
move left move right or simply halt  halting means the program has run
23:19
to completion the program consists of a set of  internal instructions you can think of it like
23:25
a flow chart that tells the machine what to do  based on the digit it reads and its internal state
23:32
you could imagine exporting these instructions to  any other Turing machine which would then perform
23:37
in exactly the same way as the first although  this sounds simple a Turing machine's arbitrarily
23:43
large memory and program mean it can execute any  computable algorithm if given enough time from
23:50
addition and subtraction to the entire youtube  algorithm it can do anything a modern computer can
23:58
that's what made the Turing machine so useful in  answering Hilbert's question on decidability when
24:04
a touring machine halts the program has finished  running and the tape is the output but sometimes a
24:10
touring machine never halts maybe it gets stuck in  an infinite loop is it possible to tell beforehand
24:16
if a program will halt or not on a particular  input Turing realized this halting problem
24:22
was very similar to the decidability problem if  he could find a way to figure out if a Turing
24:26
machine would halt then it would also be possible  to decide if a statement followed from the axioms
24:33
for example you could solve the twin prime  conjecture by writing a Turing machine program
24:37
that starts with the axioms and constructs  all theorems that can be produced in one step
24:42
using the rules of inference then it constructs  all theorems that can be produced in one step
24:47
from those and so on each time it generates a  new theorem it checks if it's the twin prime
24:52
conjecture and if it is it halts if not it never  halts so if you could solve the halting problem
25:00
you could solve the twin prime conjecture  and all sorts of other unsolved questions
25:05
so Turing said let's assume we can make a  machine h that can determine whether any
25:10
Turing machine will halt or not on a particular  input you insert the program and its input
25:16
and h simulates what will happen printing out  either halts or never halts for now we don't worry
25:24
about how h works we just know that it always  works it always gives you the right answer now
25:30
we can modify the h machine by adding additional  components one if it receives the output halts
25:37
immediately goes into an infinite loop another if  it receives never holds then it immediately halts
25:45
we can call this entire new machine h plus and  we can export the program for that entire machine
25:54
now what happens if we give this machine  its own code both as program and input
26:02
well now h is simulating what h plus  would do given its own input essentially h
26:09
has to determine the behavior of a machine  that it itself is a part of in this exact
26:16
circumstance if h concludes that h plus never  halts well this makes h plus immediately halt
26:28
if h thinks h plus will halt well then  that necessarily forces h plus to loop
26:38
whatever output the halting machine h gives it  turns out to be wrong there's a contradiction
26:47
the only explanation can be that a machine like  h can't exist there's no way to tell in general
26:53
if a touring machine will halt or not on a given  input and this means mathematics is undecidable
27:02
there is no algorithm that can always determine  whether a statement is derivable from the axioms
27:08
so something like the twin prime conjecture  might be unsolvable we might never know
27:14
whether there are infinite twin primes or not  the problem of undecidability even crops up
27:20
in physical systems in quantum mechanics one  of the most important properties of a many-body
27:26
system is the difference in energy between  its ground state and its first excited state
27:31
this is known as the spectral gap some systems  have a significant spectral gap whereas others
27:37
are gapless there are a continuum of energy levels  all the way down to the ground state and this is
27:44
important because at low temperatures gapless  quantum systems can undergo phase transitions
27:49
while gapped systems cannot they don't have  the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap
27:54
but figuring out if a system is gapped or gapless  has long been known to be a very difficult
28:02
problem only recently in 2015 did mathematicians  prove that in general the spectral gap question
28:10
is undecidable to quote the authors even a  perfect complete description of the microscopic
28:17
interactions between a material's particles is not  always enough to deduce its macroscopic properties
28:24
now remember that Turing designed his machines to  be as powerful computers as it is possible to make
28:30
to this day the best computational systems are  those that can do everything a touring machine can
28:36
this is called touring completeness and it turns  out there are many such during complete systems
28:43
although they are powerful every touring complete  system comes with a catch its own analog of the
28:49
halting problem some undecidable property of  the system Wang tiles are touring complete their
28:55
halting problem is whether or not they'll tile the  plane complex quantum systems are Turing complete
29:01
and their halting problem is the spectral gap  question and the game of life is Turing complete
29:07
its halting problem is literally whether or  not it halts there are many more examples
29:13
of this like airline ticketing systems magic the  gathering powerpoint slides and excel spreadsheets
29:19
nearly every programming language in existence is  designed to be Turing complete but in theory we
29:25
only need one programming language because  well you can program anything at all using
29:29
any Turing complete system so here's a touring  machine inside the game of life and since the
29:42
game of life is itself touring complete it should  be capable of simulating itself and indeed it is
29:56
this is the game of life  running on the game of life
30:09
the real legacy of David Hilbert's dream  is all of our modern computational devices
30:16
Kurt Gödel suffered bouts of mental instability  later in life convinced that people were trying
30:22
to poison him he refused to eat eventually  starving himself to death Hilbert died in 1943
30:31
his epitaph was his slogan from 1930. we must know  we will know the truth is we don't know sometimes
30:41
we can't know but in trying to find out we can  discover new things things that change the world
30:49
Alan Turing put his ideas about computing to  practical use in world war ii leading the team
30:54
at Bletchley Park that built real calculating  machines to crack nazi codes for the allies
30:59
by one estimate the intelligence Turing and  his colleagues gathered from decrypted messages
31:04
shortened the war by two to four years after  the war Turing and John von Neumann designed
31:10
the first true programmable electronic  computer eniac based on touring's designs
31:16
but Turing didn't live to see  his ideas develop much further
31:20
in 1952 the british government convicted him of  gross indecency upon learning he was gay he was
31:26
stripped of his security clearance and forced  to take hormones in 1954 he committed suicide
31:36
touring changed the world he is widely  considered to be the most important founding
31:41
figure in computer science all modern  computers are descended from his designs
31:46
but touring's ideas about computability  came from his concept of the Turing machine
31:52
which came from thinking about Hilbert's question  is math decidable so touring's code breaking
31:58
machines and indeed all modern computers stem from  the weird paradoxes that arise from self-reference
32:07
there is a hole at the bottom of math a hole that  means we will never know everything with certainty
32:14
there will always be true  statements that cannot be proven
32:18
and you might think this realization  would have driven mathematicians mad
32:22
and led to the disintegration of the entire  mathematical enterprise but instead thinking
32:27
about this problem transformed the concept  of infinity changed the course of a world war
32:33
and led directly to the invention of the  device you're watching this on right now
32:47
hey this video was sponsored by brilliant a  website full of interactive courses and quizzes
32:51
that delve deep into topics like math physics and  computer science now if you've gotten this far
32:57
into this video you're likely someone who would  love brilliant i've been going through their
33:01
logic course and it's really got me thinking  the problems start out easy but get more and
33:07
more challenging as you develop your understanding  and that's what i love about the site i love how
33:12
it guides you not by telling you exactly but by  exposing you to increasingly sophisticated puzzles
33:18
and at the end i feel like i've worked it out  for myself which essentially i have through
33:22
their carefully curated selection of problems  and with helpful hints and explanations for
33:26
when i get stuck now there were a lot of things  i wanted to include in this video but couldn't
33:32
because it's already over half an hour long so if  you want to explore these ideas further i'd highly
33:38
recommend their courses on number theory and  computer science fundamentals for viewers of this
33:43
channel brilliant are offering 20 off an annual  subscription to the first 200 people to sign up
33:48
just go to brilliant.org veritasium and i  will put that link down in the description
33:54
so i want to thank brilliant for sponsoring  veritasium and i want to thank you for watching
